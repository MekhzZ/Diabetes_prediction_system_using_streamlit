Diabetes Prediction System
This project is a Diabetes Prediction System built using Streamlit for the web interface and a custom-made SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for prediction. The system allows users to input medical details and get a prediction about whether or not they may have diabetes, based on the provided data.

Features
Custom SVM Classifier: A Support Vector Machine model created from scratch using Python.
Interactive Web Application: Deployed using Streamlit for easy and interactive user input.
Real-time Prediction: Provides instant results based on the input medical data.
Live Demo
You can access the live demo of the app here:

Model Details
This project implements a custom SVM classifier built from scratch using Python. The classifier is trained on diabetes data to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic patients based on various features such as:

Number of pregnancies
Glucose level
Blood pressure
Skin thickness
Insulin level
BMI
Age
You can find the code for the custom SVM classifier in my GitHub repository below:
