Diabetes Prediction System
This is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using a custom-built Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The app is built with Python, Streamlit, and includes a machine learning model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

Features
Custom SVM Classifier: A custom SVM classifier built from scratch in Python.
Real-time Prediction: Users can input health metrics like glucose levels, BMI, etc., and get a prediction on whether they are likely to have diabetes.
Streamlit Deployment: Deployed using Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface.
Demo

Diabetes Prediction System

Dataset
The model is trained using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which contains medical diagnostic data for predicting diabetes. Features include:

Pregnancies
Glucose Level
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Age
How it Works
Input Fields: Users can provide their health information such as glucose levels, BMI, etc.
Prediction: The app will use the custom-built SVM model to predict whether the user has diabetes or not.
Custom SVM Classifier
This project features an SVM classifier implemented from scratch in Python. The model uses linear classification to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

You can find the complete implementation of the SVM classifier in my GitHub repository:
