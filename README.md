# Diabetes Prediction System using Streamlit

This project is a **Diabetes Prediction System** built using **Streamlit** for the web interface and a **custom-made SVM (Support Vector Machine)** classifier for prediction. The system allows users to input medical details and get a prediction about whether or not they may have diabetes, based on the provided data.

## Features
- **Custom SVM Classifier**: A Support Vector Machine model created from scratch using Python.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Deployed using Streamlit for easy and interactive user input.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Provides instant results based on the input medical data.

## Live Demo
You can access the live demo of the app here:
